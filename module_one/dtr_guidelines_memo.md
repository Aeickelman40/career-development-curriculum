# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
* How would you describe your work style?
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

Project: Intention Timer

Group Member Names: Michelle Kaplan and Alex Eickelman

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): Accurately recreate the composition using html, css, and javascript. Set realistic expectations (aiming for 3's, but 4's would be nice). Incorporate the lessons learned during Balancing Act (planning ahead, class naming, DRY format, etc.). 
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Being considerate of each others time/workstyles/strenghts. Find a balance of imaginative and object oriented thinking styles to get a cohesive project done. 

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: Knowing when we should figure out things independently and reaching out to help from others. Have open communication and not feel like you have to hide something. 

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?): Show up @ 8AM and review each others code from the previous night. Stay after class until 5 at the earliest, let each other other know ahead of time if we are unable to meet schedule expectations. 

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?): Communicate daily through phone, in-person, and slack. Be on the same level with naming things, developing a plan from the start that goes well with our work habits. 

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): Use flexbox/grid to save time (if it actually saves us time), feel better with Javascript, clean html/css, get a good understanding of github (master, branches, push/pull) for a team project. 

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Find strenghts/weaknesses, make sure one person isn't doing too much/not enough. 

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): Setting daily goals, utilize github projects to make tasks seem managable. 

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Be open to receiving and giving constructive feedback, be nice and easy to work with. 

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools): GitHub projects/slack/phone/person.
