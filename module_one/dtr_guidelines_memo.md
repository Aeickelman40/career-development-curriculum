### DTR

Project: Intention Timer

Group Member Names: Michelle Kaplan and Alex Eickelman

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): Accurately recreate the composition using html, css, and javascript. Set realistic expectations (aiming for 3's, but 4's would be nice). Incorporate the lessons learned during Balancing Act (planning ahead, class naming, DRY format, etc.). 
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Being considerate of each others time/workstyles/strenghts. Find a balance of imaginative and object oriented thinking styles to get a cohesive project done. 

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: Knowing when we should figure out things independently and reaching out to help from others. Have open communication and not feel like you have to hide something. 

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?): Show up @ 8AM and review each others code from the previous night. Stay after class until 5 at the earliest, let each other other know ahead of time if we are unable to meet schedule expectations. 

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?): Communicate daily through phone, in-person, and slack. Be on the same level with naming things, developing a plan from the start that goes well with our work habits. 

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): Use flexbox/grid to save time (if it actually saves us time), feel better with Javascript, clean html/css, get a good understanding of github (master, branches, push/pull) for a team project. 

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Find strenghts/weaknesses, make sure one person isn't doing too much/not enough. 

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): Setting daily goals, utilize github projects to make tasks seem managable. 

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Be open to receiving and giving constructive feedback, be nice and easy to work with. 

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools): GitHub projects/slack/phone/person. 

Day 1 Agenda: 

- Create repository files (html/css/assets)
- Make sure we both have equal access to master
- Research flexbox and grid
- Develop a plan on how to build pages (print out and write on paper headers, p, etc. ) find what javascript elements needed. 
- Potentially start HTML if time permits. 
- Update project board
